# Air-Drawing



This project, "AirDrawing," utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a webcam to create a virtual drawing application. Users can draw on the screen by moving their fingers in the air, with different colors selectable via on-screen buttons. The application processes hand landmarks to track finger movements and render the drawings in real-time.
